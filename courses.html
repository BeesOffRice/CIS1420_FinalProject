            <h1>Some Notable projects</h1>
            <article>
                <h2>Card Game</h2>
                <p>For a class I took at Oakland University, we had a group project where we made a card game using
                    Unity. The card game worked
                    like this:</p>
                <blockquote> 2 players are dealt cards.
                    Each player drags a card to the center, which either heals themselves or damages their opponents.
                    The players play until one player runs out of hp or the time runs out.</blockquote>

                <p>I handled some of the art assets, the health/damage system, the dice roll, the turn system, and the
                    drag
                    and drop functionality.
                    We also learned about the scrum process during the making of this project.

                <h2>Library System</h2>
                <p>This project was done for <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming(Java)">CIS-2141</abbr>. I created
                    a
                    Java
                    application that acted as a pseudo library that you could rent and return books from. I had to
                    program a sort of database
                    for users and books that could be edited, added to, deleted, and accessed in general. I also had to
                    make sure that each user could
                    perform several other functions like checking what books are available, or renting or returning
                    books. This was my first
                    time working with hashMaps, and I learnt many convenient methods for sorting and creating classes.

                <h2>Maze Game</h2>
                <p>In <abbr title="Intro to Programming (Java)">CIS-1500</abbr> the final project was to make a maze
                    minigame using JavaFX.
                    The player would start in the center of the maze, and could choose a room to move into. The room
                    would either generate
                    a random monster, or be empty. Once no monsters a in the room, the player could search the room for
                    gold and select a new room to
                    go into. I programmed this project using a 2d array as the base for the maze, and then separating
                    each type of task or character
                    into different class to make programming easier.
